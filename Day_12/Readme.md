## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated number** in `nums`, return _this repeated number_.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

## Example

Input: `nums = [1,3,4,2,2]`  
Output: `2`

Input: `nums = [3,1,3,4,2]`  
Output: `3`

Input: `nums = [1,1]`  
Output: `1`

Input: `nums = [1,1,2]`
