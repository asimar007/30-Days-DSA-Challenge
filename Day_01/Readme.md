# Two Sum

Problem link: [Two Sum - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

## Example

Input: `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9`  
Output: `[0,1]`  
Explanation: Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9`, we return `[0, 1]`.

# Maximum Subarray

Problem link: [Maximum Subarray - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-subarray/description/)

## Problem Description

Given an integer array `nums`, find the subarray
with the largest sum, and return its sum.

## Example

Input: `nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]`  
Output: `6`  
Explanation: The contiguous subarray `[4,-1,2,1]` has the largest sum = `6`.
