# Single Number

Problem link: [Single Number - LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)

## Problem Description

Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and without using extra memory.

## Example

Input: `nums = [2,2,1]`  
Output: `1`

Explanation:  
1 appears only once in the array, so it's the single number.

Input: `nums = [4,1,2,1,2]`  
Output: `4`

Explanation:  
4 appears only once in the array, so it's the single number.
